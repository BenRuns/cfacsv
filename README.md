### Code For America to CSV
## cfacsv gem

This gem is created to be used with jekyll webpages  It does one thing. On page build, it converts the _data/projects.yml file into the csv file in the format the Code for America requested and places it in projects/projects.csv

It's rather fragile code at the moment and I welcome anyone that would like to help me write tests and increase it's usability etc before publishing it to rubygems
